# DAMG-6210-Group3-Project

# Mission Statement
Build a secure, campus-only peer-to-peer marketplace where students can buy and sell pre-owned goods and services with escrow-protected payments and reputation signals. By verifying university affiliation and enforcing transparent policies, the platform reduces transaction risk, promotes trust, and enables fast, fair resolution of issues.

# Mission Objectives
1. Campus Verification — Restrict access to users with a verified university email/domain and maintain active/inactive account status.
2. ⁠Listings & Catalog — Support item listings with categories, pricing, quantity, media, and searchable metadata; enforce listing states (active/paused/sold-out).
3. ⁠Order Lifecycle — Enable end-to-end ordering from offer → order creation → status tracking with clear state transitions.
4. ⁠Escrow Payments for Meetups — Capture buyer funds into escrow on payment success, hold until in-person delivery/acceptance, then automatically release to the seller or refund per policy.
5. ⁠Reputation & Reviews — Allow post-transaction, bilateral star ratings and comments; compute seller metrics (average rating, completion rate, dispute rate) and surface badges.
6. ⁠Risk & Disputes — Provide a structured dispute workflow (open → investigate → resolve to release/refund), with audit logs and evidence attachments; auto-timeouts for unconfirmed deliveries.
7. ⁠Auditability & Analytics — Log critical actions (payments, status changes, dispute decisions) and provide reporting on marketplace health (active users, category performance, refund/dispute rates).
